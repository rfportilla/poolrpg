1. SummaryOfIntent

In the infinite wisdom of a few, whom I have not met, the rest of us were given freedom of choice.  It has been great.  To continue in this same example, I have proposed that further choice be granted to those who find the regular games of pool restricting.  This is the first attempt at doing so with an RPG style of play.  

2. Premise

People often think that freedom of choice comes from removing restrictions.  However, people are often wrong.  Removing restrictions just creates chaos and nobody finds that fun.  This actually has a backfiring effect.  Simply put, when people have no rules, they do nothing good with it.  Creativity dissipates because there are no constraints to work against.  

The truth is that people want rules.  In rules, we find comfort and safety.  To promote creativity, you have to create rules and from this comes decision making and exploration.  I discovered this on a pool table.  My answer is to attempt to design an RPG around common games like 8 ball, 9 ball, etc. (yes, there is a 10 ball, therefore "etc.")
